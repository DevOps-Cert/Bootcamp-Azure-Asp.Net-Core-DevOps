# Goal
Analyze the sentiment of the text entered by the user to see if itâ€™s positive or negative by sending it to a REST API that will analyze it and also detect the language used by the user.  For doing that, we'll modify the function already created by calling the Text Analytics API of the Microsoft Cognitive Services.
We'll be making two API calls.  The first one will return the language of the sentence entered by the user and the second call will return the sentiment of the sentence as a number between 0 and 1 (0 meaning negatitve and 1 meaning positive).

Have the audience type what they feel about the local team making it to this year's finals.  This should be fun  :-)

## Add the required usings
Ask the attendees to open the file 1.txt in the Code Snippets folder.  Copy an paste the code in the function editor.

## Add the detect language code
Ask the attendees to open the file 2.txt in the Code Snippets folder.  Modify the Run task to add code to detect the language that the sentence is written in.
Ask the attendees to open the file 3.txt in the Code Snippets folder.  Add the DetectLanguage() function below the Run task.

## Add the detect sentiment code
Ask the attendees to open the file 4.txt in the Code Snippets folder.  Add the DetectSentiment() function below the DetectLanguage() function.
In the Run task, add a call to the DectectSentiment() function below the call to the DetectLanguage() function.
```
var _Sentiment = await DetectSentiment(comment, BaseUrl, AccountKey);
```
